AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Feingold syndrome 1 (referred to as FS1 in this 
      GeneReview) is characterized by digital anomalies (shortening of the 2nd and 5th 
      middle phalanx of the hand, clinodactyly of the 5th finger, syndactyly of toes 
      2-3 and/or 4-5, thumb hypoplasia), microcephaly, facial dysmorphism (short 
      palpebral fissures and micrognathia), gastrointestinal atresias (primarily 
      esophageal and/or duodenal), and mild-to-moderate learning disability. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of FS1 is established in a proband with 
      suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MYCN 
      identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: 
      Gastrointestinal atresia is treated surgically. Mild-to-moderate learning 
      disabilities are treated in the usual manner. GENETIC COUNSELING: FS1 is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 60% of individuals with 
      Feingold syndrome 1 have an affected parent; the proportion of FS1 caused by a de 
      novo MYCN pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with FS1 has 
      a 50% chance of inheriting the MYCN pathogenic variant. When the MYCN pathogenic 
      variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.
